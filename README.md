# 📘 Welcome to the Arabic Text Summarization Project

## Overview
In this project, we'll be delving into the fascinating task of text summarization with a focus on the Arabic language 📚. Our goal is to develop a model that can efficiently summarize Arabic text, making it easier to grasp the essence of large documents quickly 🚀.

## Project Objectives
- **Understanding Text Summarization**: Learn the fundamentals of how text summarization works 📝.
- **Exploring NLP Models**: Get hands-on experience with advanced NLP models like AraGPT2 🤖.
- **Model Fine-Tuning and Training**: Discover how to fine-tune pre-trained models on a custom dataset for specific tasks like summarization 🧠.
- **Practical Application**: Build a model that can summarize Arabic texts 🌐.

## Dataset
We'll be using a custom dataset of Arabic texts and their summaries 📖. This dataset will allow us to train our model to understand and generate concise summaries.

We generated this dataset using ChatGPT 😜
